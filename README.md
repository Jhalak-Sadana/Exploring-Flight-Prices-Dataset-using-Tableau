# Exploring-Flight-Prices-Dataset-using-Tableau
In this project, I have explore the Flight Prices dataset, which contains information about flight fares for various airlines and routes. I have used Tableau to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and answer some questions about flight fares. I have start by checking the summary statistics for each column in the dataset and then move on to explore the relationship between variables. Finally, I have create visualizations to present the findings in a clear and concise manner. The aim of this project is to understand the factors that influence flight prices and provide useful insights to airlines and travelers alike.
